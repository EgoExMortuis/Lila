# Lila

This repository contains the code for **Lila**, an AI assistant app written using **SwiftUI**. The app provides a main menu that links to several features including a chat interface, task list, calendar event creation, personal stats, and a mind palace.

## Project Structure

- `LilaApp/` – SwiftUI source files for the iOS application.
  - `LilaApp.swift` – Application entry point.
  - `Views/` – Contains the SwiftUI views.
    - `MainMenuView.swift` – Main menu with navigation links to each feature.
    - Other files under `Views/` are placeholder views for their respective features.

To open the project, create a new Xcode project or workspace and include the files under `LilaApp`. You can then build and run the app on an iOS simulator or device.

## Main Menu

The main menu presents the following options:

- **Chat with Lila** – Opens a chat interface.
- **Task List** – Displays tasks.
- **Calendar / Event Creation** – Lets you create calendar events.
- **Personal Stats** – Shows stats similar to an RPG character sheet.
- **Mind Palace** – A space to attach notes to virtual objects.

Each option currently navigates to a placeholder view which you can extend with additional functionality.
