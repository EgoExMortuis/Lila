This code will be written entirely using swift and will be tested and run in xcode.
An AI assistant app with a main menu with several options: Chat with Lila (AI chat bot) which is a typical chat interface with an image of Lila's face in the top left hand corner. She blinks and is emotive. The AI will be required to give an emotion with the first 10 characters which is ommited from the response and triggers an animation that matches the emotion.
Another option that can be selected from the main page is a button takes you to a task list. The task list has a toggle that allows you to select between a checklist view and a kanban view.
You are given tokens and currency for completed tasks.
There is another button that takes you to a page that allows for you to easily create a calendar event/invite.
There is a seperate page that takes you to your personal stats (which reads like a character sheet for an RPG)
Another button launches the "mind palace" which is a unique page that enables you to attach memos and notes to bounching sprites and items in a virtual home.
Tasks can be linked to items and objects in the mind palace.
